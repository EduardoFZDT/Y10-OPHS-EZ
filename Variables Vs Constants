#This is a comment
#Variables Vs Constant
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1Name = "Spero's stars"
Team2Name = "Croydon Kebabs"

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables store a value (can change)
#Variables can NOT start with a numnber
#e.g 1TeamName = "Croydon Kebabs"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Variables cannot have a space in the name
#e.g Team Name= "Croydon Kebabs"
#This will cause a syntax error

#This is an example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER =3

#The value is a CONSTANT do NOT change
